# RichFridge
project-eventsearchengine created by GitHub Classroom

## What is it

This app allows the user to enter the ingredients they have in their fridge. It will perform a search and recommend recipes based on these ingredients

### How does it work

The user enters the ingredients in his fridge, these are stored in an SQL database on the phone.

The recipes are also taken from an internal database. This should have been an API call, but because of lack of time we decided to take this approach
